<h2>What I have used in my project</h2>
<p>For this project I have chosen not to use a CSS library like Bootstrap.</p>
<p>I have used SASS for my styles. I have not used BEM, but I have been inspired by it when naming my classes.</p>
<p>I have only used vanilla JavaScript, and I have split my code up using modules.</p>
<p>I have not used JS libraries.</p>
